# Personal Portfolio

## About:
Every developer must have a page of his own, acting like a landing page that which complements and redirects to his github, linkedin and demonstrates a little of what he or she can do.

This is my personal portfolio page until now. 

I decided to take a mobile first aproach, due to that being the most common way for people to view any page now a days. However, it works on large and medium/tablet screens.

This project consists of only 3 files and i would like to eventually configure routes, and use handlebars as a template engine. However i want to do that after i learn about React.js and i would love to learn about three.js to make it a spectacular page.


## Current version
Everything works, all my most memorable work is listed and shown with each of their link to the page and github code.
